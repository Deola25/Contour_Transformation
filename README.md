# Contour_Transformation

This script uses the arcpy package to batch convert contour lines to a managable continuous surface that can be queried.
The contour lines were first converted to rasters and then contour polygons, which is a manageable format compared to rasters.
If your project would need to be hosted on a web based platform, this is the most ideal method.
